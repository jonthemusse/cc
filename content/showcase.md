## What is slime?

![image alt text](/img/blue_slime.png)

Slime is a gooey, sticky substance made by mixing a compound called _pancolorum bugenum_, or colloquially knows as **rainbow sneeze**, with swamp thing extract. Slime was first invented in the year 800 AD, by a stable hand named Fred.

## Is slime dangerous?

Very. Unless you are a mysterious kitten, in which case it is quite safe and marginally nutritious.

### A recipe of basic slime follows
<pre>
  <code class="language-css">
  /* PostCSS code by PrismJS */

  pre {
    background: #1a1a1d;
    padding: 20px;
    border-radius: 8px;
    font-size: 1rem;
    overflow: auto;

    @media (--phone) {
      white-space: pre-wrap;
      word-wrap: break-word;
    }

    code {
      background: none !important;
      color: #ccc;
      padding: 0;
      font-size: inherit;

      .dark-theme & {
        color: inherit;
      }
    }
  }
  </code>
</pre>


#### Are there any safe alternatives to slime?

Yes, you can choose to live in utter boredom and not look at slime. Be aware that if you are _*not*_ a musterioys kitten, even a sidelong glance through a mirror across a closed door in a dark room might be enough exposure to start feeling the effects of slime.
