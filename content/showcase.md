## What is slime?

![image alt text](/img/blue_slime.png)

Slime is a simple non-Newtonian fluid that is using something called borade assid which is the activator, and glue that is made out of a polymer material.

## Is slime dangerous?

Very. Unless you are a Mysterious Kitten, in which case it is quite safe and marginally nutritious.

### Here is a simple recipe for basic slime
<pre>
  <code class="language-css">
1 cup Elmer's glue
1 tablespoon of activator to start with
1 or 2 drops of food coloring (optional)
borax and hot water / detergent / contact solution with baking soda
Maybe some add ins like glitter or instant snow that makes it cloud slime and softens it
  </code>
</pre>

You will also need a bowl to stir slime in, and a slime stirring spoon. Also, a container to store the ready slime in.

## Directions
Poor the cup of glue into your bowl. Then, if you would like color add about 1 or 2 drops of food coloring, and then mix it all together.

Next, pour the 1 tablespoon of your chosen activator in the bowl, and quickly start mixing the liquid. You should start seeing it become a solid, but if it doesn’t come off the sides of the bowl add one more tablespoon of activator. Repeat mixing and once it comes off the bowl start poking it with your fingers. Don’t poke if it is still a liquid, just keep adding activator until it cooperates.

Once the slime is fully ready it should be the tiniest bit sticky, becauseit will over time either dry out or melt in the container. If you would like to add a add-in such as glitter you are welcome to. If you use detergent as your activator, Tide is the best choice to use in your slime.

## What if I don't want to make slime?
Yes, you can choose to live in utter boredom and not look at slime. Be aware that if you are _*not*_ a musterioys kitten, even a sidelong glance through a mirror across a closed door in a dark room might be enough exposure to start feeling the effects of slime.

**Thank you!**
